Social Network for Language Exchange

## User stories

I can register a new account.

I can log in.

I can create and update my profile.

At a minimum, I can chose which language I speak, and which language I am learning.

As a logged in user, I can create a post.

My post will show what language I speak and what language I am posting in.

The post will default to my profile's target language, but I am not limited to this.

Other users can comment on my post.

Likewise, I can comment on their posts.

I can see posts by others.

I can chose to see only posts in my native OR target language.

I can like others' posts.

I can revoke my like.

I can follow users.

Users can follow me.

I can search for users based on their languages (default is inverse of my languages; )

I can send and receive private messages.

## Stretch Goals

I can toggle my news feed between people I follow, languages I'm learning, or all posts.

I can create and join a chat room.

## MVP

Full CRUD finctionality can be met with user controls.
Initially I don't plan to allow users to edit posts or comments, but deletion is fine.

Currently planning to use the MERN stack. I was playing around with Python/Django, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to add all this functionaltiy in addition to learning an entire stack.

Current option is Redux. This app will likely need a lot of state management and prop-drilling might not be the best way to handle all the moving parts.
